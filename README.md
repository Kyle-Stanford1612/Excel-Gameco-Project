# Excel-Gameco-Project
This repository contains Excel files documenting an analysis for a student project I completed when studying with CareerFoundry. This was my first data analysis project which culminated in the creation of a PowerPoint presentation with marketing recommendations across major geographic regions

## Project Context:

![image](https://github.com/Kyle-Stanford1612/Excel-Gameco-Project/blob/main/Example%20Presentation%20Viz%20-%20GameCo.png?raw=true)

GameCo is a new video game company with markets across the globe. They want to understand market trends to inform the development and marketing of new games.

## Key Questions:

● Are certain types of games more popular than others?

● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?

● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?

● How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

## Data and Tools Used:

[Historical sales of video games that have sold over 10,000 copies between 1980 and 2020](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx) - from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/)

**Excel** was used to perform data cleaning, analysis, and create visualisations. **PowerPoint** was used to format and highlight insights from these visualisations.

## Folders:

Project files are stored using the following folder structure:

● *1. Project Management*: Contains the project brief.

● *2. Data*: Contains the original and cleaned version of the VGChartz video games sales data.

● *3. Data Prep and Analysis*: Contains Excel files documenting data cleaning and analyses including visualisations.

● *4. Sent to Client*: Contains a project reflections document and the final presentation.
